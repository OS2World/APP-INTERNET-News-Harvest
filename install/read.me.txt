Appendix 1 - News Harvest under OS/2 Warp 3
-------------------------------------------
Our team can think of no reason why News Harvest should not work under
OS/2 Warp 3 + fixpacks.  However KRT runs on a shoestring budget, and
resources to test and develop on Warp 3 are simply not available.

If you have a problem with News Harvest and OS/2 Warp 3, we will endeavour
to rememdy the situation, but we do not have a running Warp 3 machine to
perform testing on.  (Having given away our old Warp versions to needy 
people).
