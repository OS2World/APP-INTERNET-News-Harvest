News Harvest lets you extract binaries from all your favourite news groups while you work, while you sleep, or while you watch. Fire and Forget binary news extractor.


INFORMATION
-----------

News Harvest is an OS/2 Presentation Manger and Windows 95/98/NT application for the automatic retrieval of Usenet News binary articles.

The main design impetus was to create a Fire and Forget utility that would process any number of groups over any number of servers with no user-intervention. This is indeed the case -- once News Harvest is configured with host and group information, a single command will run the process to completion.

A binary news harvester with such simplicity of operation is often low on features. This is not the case with News Harvest:

    * YEnc encodig support
    * Multi-threaded, fully 32-bit executable.
    * Completly automatic operation.
    * Rebuilds multipart articles.
    * Remembers past downloads.
    * Utilises SPAM-keyword filtering.
    * Fully configurable output paths.
    * Handles abrupt disconnections (re-connects).
    * Updates Netscape Navigator news file (optional).
    * Very low, average CPU load.
    * Comprehensive logging information (optional).
    * WPS Drag and Drop (for OS/2).
    * Output displayed in ordered and intuitive manner.
    * On-the-fly changing of configuration.
    * Complete online manual.
