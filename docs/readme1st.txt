    NEW: Better handling of dodgey encodings, particularly multiple binaries
         per post.

    NEW: Few bug fixes
    
    
    Welcome to Beta 0.3
    
    I'm not sure what happened to Beta 0.2, did anyone get one?  I reckon
    I got caught-up doing other things, forgot to send it, and by the time
    I realised there was a few new bits & bobs.
    
    Not much has changed, most of my time has gone into News Scrape PM.
    I've been tinkering with the idea of changing "News Scrape" to
    "Harvest News", not sure if I will yet though. (Any thoughts on this?)
    
    
    Happy News-Scraping.
    
    PS> Have you read the (constantly updated) documentation lately ?!




    
    Remeber this is BETA software.  Don't run it on a machine
    that can't have it's drive filled up with crap, 'cause it'll
    hurt I promise!  All I can say is that I run it here, on my 
    machine, and it hasn't stuffed anything I didn't want it to.
   
    And if something bad happens I promise to be sympathetic.
